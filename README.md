# ðŸ‘‹Welcome to My Navigation Library 

Navigation is tough to tackle when you're learning, but it's also a great way to practice your CSS and JS skills. There can be a lot going on in a 60-ish px high space...responsiveness, flexbox, grid, click events, transitions, buttons, links, lists, animations, hover effects, images, SVGs, and on and on.

I'm creating a resource to serve as a reference and sharing for others who may be struggling with building their own navigation components. I'll start with the basics and  add more creative examples as I build for my own projects.
